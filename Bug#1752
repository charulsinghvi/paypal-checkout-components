[Bug] Popup flashes on screen for a second when onClick() returns actions.reject() #1752


🐞 Describe the Bug
  I'm attempting to do asynchronous validation following the docs here. However, the popup window seems to open, then immediately close when my onClick() method returns actions.reject()

🔬 Minimal Reproduction
  paypal
    .Buttons({
      onClick: function (data, actions) {
        return actions.reject();
      },
    })
    .render("#paypal-button-container");
  
😕 Actual Behavior
  PayPal popup opens, then immediately closes.

🤔 Expected Behavior
  I would expect that the popup doesn't open at all when onClick() is rejected.

🌍 Environment
  Browser version: Firefox 92.0
  OS version: MacOS 11.5.2
  SDK version (window.paypal.version): 5.0.258

Solution:

  You can return the action in form of a promise & set timout to be very less. Example:
  paypal
    .Buttons({
    onClick: function(data, actions) {
      return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1)).then(() => {
          return actions.reject();
        })
      },
    })
    .render("#paypal-button-container");
    
    We can also add some error message incase if the window opens which we don't want to open up in the manner,

    onClick: function(data,actions) {
        console.log("onClick");
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            reject(Error("error: async onClick"));
        });
    },
